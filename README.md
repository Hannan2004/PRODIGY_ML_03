# Dog and Cat Image Classification

## Overview

This project is a simple image classification task that distinguishes between images of dogs and cats. It utilizes a Support Vector Machine (SVM) algorithm for classification. The SVM is a supervised machine learning model that is effective in binary classification tasks, making it suitable for our purpose of distinguishing between two classes: dogs and cats.

The project aims to showcase how SVM, a popular algorithm in machine learning, can be applied to image classification tasks. It uses a dataset of labeled images containing both dogs and cats for training and evaluation.
